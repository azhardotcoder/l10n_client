Localization client
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The localization client project (formerly known as live translation) provides 
live site interface translation updates from a known localization server (see
l10n_server project for more information on that).

We have the code developed for Drupal 5.x right now, check out that branch 
for more information.
